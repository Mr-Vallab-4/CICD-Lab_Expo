# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using machine learning techniques trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Deployment-ready pipeline integrated with CI/CD principles

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD automation)

## 💻 Run Locally
